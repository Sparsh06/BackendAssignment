# Youtube Fetch Api
An API to fetch latest videos from youtube sorted in reverse chronological order of their publishing date-time from YouTube for a given tag/search query in a paginated response
I have used Django for the given assignment. I have used cron jobs method to fetch API for GET request and given below refernce for what is cron-jobs, it is django based library for interacting with API.
Used Cron Jobs [django_cron](https://django-cron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) to fetch videos after every 10 minutes using [Youtube Data Api](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list) and save it to the db

## How I made it 
- As this project is based on Django, your system need to have proper python setup, refer [this](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Go the project through the terminal and install all dependencies by using typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal
- Inside the `setting.py` file, fill the variable `GOOGLE_API_KEYS` with all the API Keys available,the list should be filled as `['API_KEY_1','API_KEY_2',...]`
- For getting an API key I have follow your given reference links for youtube API[this](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started)
- Setup crontab to run Job, Follow [this](https://django-cron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)
- Run the server using `python mange.py runserver`
